  "Shop products sold by e-commerce websites themselves only.";

Top retailer websites such as Amazon are [often embroiled by bogus third-party
sellers selling fake or shoddy
products](https://www.wired.com/story/how-shop-safe-amazon/). It can be even
more harmful if the products are related to personal health.

One way to address is to only shop products sold by the retailer website itself.
This browser extension automatically filters the search results on Amazon to
Amazon-sold only.

Currently support Amazon US and Canada.
